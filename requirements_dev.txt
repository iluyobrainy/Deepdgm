This has been my thought for a while now, how do you run sagemath in vscode and download it vscode, previous i had to get ubuntu on my windows using wsl todownload sagemath there.  Secondly i just need to run this right  python run_research.py --hours 8 --checkpoint-interval 300 to get everything? what if 8  hours is not enough and it stops can i run it again and it will continue from where it stopped
